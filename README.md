# Customer Support Ticket Triage OpenEnv

This project scaffolds an OpenEnv environment for customer support ticket triage. The environment simulates a real support workflow where an agent reads an incoming ticket, classifies it, sets priority, assigns the correct queue, adds tags, decides whether it needs escalation, and selects an appropriate response template.

The domain is strong for Round 1 because it is:

- clearly real-world
- easy to evaluate deterministically
- multi-step rather than single-shot
- rich enough for easy, medium, and hard tasks
- well-suited to partial-progress reward shaping

## Round 1 Fit

This environment is designed to satisfy the Round 1 requirements:

- typed `Observation`, `Action`, and `Reward` models
- standard `reset()`, `step()`, and `state()` API
- 3 graded tasks with difficulty progression
- deterministic grader returning `0.0` to `1.0`
- meaningful reward shaping from grader deltas
- baseline script using the OpenAI API client
- extra endpoints: `/tasks`, `/grader`, `/baseline`
- container-ready layout for Hugging Face Spaces

## Environment Concept

Each episode contains one support ticket scenario. The agent must complete the correct triage actions within a limited number of turns. The environment tracks state changes and scores the final ticket against an expected triage target.

The current scaffold focuses on triage decisions:

- set `category`
- set `priority`
- set `queue`
- set `response_template`
- add relevant tags
- mark escalation when required
- optionally mark resolved
- finish the episode

## Action Space

The scaffolded action types are:

- `set_category`
- `set_priority`
- `set_queue`
- `set_response_template`
- `add_tag`
- `mark_escalated`
- `mark_resolved`
- `add_internal_note`
- `finish`

The `Action` model is defined in [src/models.py](/home/eswarbalu/Desktop/mets-competition/src/models.py).

## Observation Space

Each observation includes:

- task id and difficulty
- current turn and max turns
- the current ticket snapshot
- required outputs for the episode
- allowed action list
- action history

The `Observation` model is defined in [src/models.py](/home/eswarbalu/Desktop/mets-competition/src/models.py).

## Tasks

The scaffold includes three deterministic tasks:

1. `refund_status_easy`
   - Straightforward billing refund triage
   - Expected outcome: billing category, medium priority, billing queue

2. `account_takeover_medium`
   - Account access and security triage
   - Expected outcome: security category, high priority, escalation

3. `vip_duplicate_charge_hard`
   - High-risk VIP billing dispute with churn risk
   - Expected outcome: urgent priority, executive billing queue, escalation, multiple tags

Task definitions live in [src/tasks.py](/home/eswarbalu/Desktop/mets-competition/src/tasks.py).

## Reward Design

The scaffold uses grader delta reward shaping:

- positive reward when the ticket moves closer to the target state
- penalty for invalid or wasteful actions
- penalty for finishing early with missing required decisions
- completion bonus tied to final grader score

This is implemented in [src/rewards.py](/home/eswarbalu/Desktop/mets-competition/src/rewards.py).

## Grader Design

The grader compares the final ticket state against expected outputs using weighted components:

- category
- priority
- queue
- response template
- escalation flag
- resolution flag
- required tags

The grader returns:

- final score from `0.0` to `1.0`
- component-level breakdown
- missing or incorrect fields

This is implemented in [src/graders.py](/home/eswarbalu/Desktop/mets-competition/src/graders.py).

## API Surface

The starter API exposes:

- `GET /health`
- `GET /tasks`
- `POST /reset`
- `POST /step`
- `GET /state`
- `GET /grader`
- `POST /baseline`

The FastAPI app lives in [src/api.py](/home/eswarbalu/Desktop/mets-competition/src/api.py).

## Quick Start

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the API locally:

```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

Run tests:

```bash
pytest
```

Run the baseline:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
python baseline/run_baseline.py
```

## What To Do Next

1. Tighten `openenv.yaml` to the exact schema expected by your installed OpenEnv version.
2. Expand task coverage from the starter scenarios into richer datasets or generators.
3. Improve the baseline prompt and action loop for stronger reproducibility.
4. Add end-to-end validation with `openenv validate`, Docker, and Hugging Face Space deployment.
